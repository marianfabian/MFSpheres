This software is based on the article "Homotopy Based Skinning of Spheres" written by Marián Fabian, Pavel Chalmovianský and Martina Bátorová.
MFSpheres, was implemented in C# using the open-source library [OpenTK](https://opentk.net) version 3.0.1. This program is designed to visualize
and modify specific examples of sets of spheres with coplanar centers and their skinning surfaces (branched and tubular).
